        Parameters
        ----------

        end_date : pd.Timestamp
            End date of the computed matrix.

        The algorithm implemented here can be broken down into the following
        stages:

        0. Build a dependency graph of all terms in `terms`.  Topologically
        sort the graph to determine an order in which we can compute the terms.

        1. Ask our AssetFinder for a "lifetimes matrix", which should contain,
        for each date between start_date and end_date, a boolean value for each
        known asset indicating whether the asset existed on that date.

        2. Compute each term in the dependency order determined in (0), caching
        the results in a a dictionary to that they can be fed into future
        terms.

        3. For each date, determine the number of assets passing **all**
        filters. The sum, N, of all these values is the total number of rows in
        our output frame, so we pre-allocate an output array of length N for
        each factor in `terms`.

        4. Fill in the arrays allocated in (3) by copying computed values from
        our output cache into the corresponding rows.

        5. Stick the values computed in (4) into a DataFrame and return it.

        Step 0 is performed in `build_dependency_graph`.
        Step 1 is performed in `self.build_lifetimes_matrix`.
        Step 2 is performed in `self.compute_chunk`.
        Steps 3, 4, and 5 are performed in self._format_factor_matrix.
